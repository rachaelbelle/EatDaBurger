# Eat Da Burger 🍽🍔🍴

### Welcome!

This is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). 

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page.

* Your app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


### Hosting on Heroku
